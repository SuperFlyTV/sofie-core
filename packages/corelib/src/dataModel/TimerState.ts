/**
 * Timing state for a timer, optimized for efficient client rendering.
 * When running, the client calculates current time from zeroTime.
 * When paused, the duration is frozen and sent directly.
 *
 * Each variant carries the timestamp of its transition into the *other* state, so that a transition
 * whose time is known in advance does not depend on a new state being published at that moment
 * (which would cost accuracy - the value would be stale until the message lands, then jump):
 * - `pauseTime` on a running timer: when it freezes (e.g. when the current part ends and overrun begins)
 * - `resumesAt` on a paused timer: when it starts running (e.g. a scheduled start)
 *
 * The other one is always null/absent, and a state therefore has at most one transition. Anything
 * with further transitions relies on an updated state being published in between; there is a
 * multi-second window to do so in practice, so that is safe.
 *
 * Client rendering logic:
 * ```typescript
 * if (state.paused === true) {
 *   if (state.resumesAt != null && now >= state.resumesAt) {
 *     // Scheduled start has passed, running since then
 *     duration = state.duration - (now - state.resumesAt)
 *   } else {
 *     // Manually paused by user, already pushing/overrun, or waiting for a scheduled start
 *     duration = state.duration
 *   }
 * } else if (state.pauseTime != null && now >= state.pauseTime) {
 *   // Auto-pause at overrun (current part ended)
 *   duration = state.zeroTime - state.pauseTime
 * } else {
 *   // Running normally
 *   duration = state.zeroTime - now
 * }
 * ```
