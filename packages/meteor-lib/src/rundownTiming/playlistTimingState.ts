/**
 * Assembles the playlist-level timing values as TimerStates (a PlaylistTimingStateDoc), for
 * publishing over DDP (the `playlistTimingState` publication).
 *
 * There is deliberately no timing math of its own in this module:
 * - the time-dependence of the playlist aggregates lives inside RundownTimingCalculator
 *   (`remainingPlaylistDurationState` / `livePushTime` on the RundownTimingContext)
 * - the remaining/estimated-end shapes live in `PlaylistTiming.getRemainingDurationState` /
 *   `getEstimatedEndState` (of which the old numeric helpers are evaluations)
 * - the over/under balance is composed here as a target/projected TimerState pair, and
 *   `getPlaylistTimingDiff` is its evaluation at `now` — there is no separate diff formula.
 *
 * Consumers evaluate the published states locally with `timerStateToDuration` /
 * `timerStateToZeroTime`; the server only needs to republish when playout or ingest state changes.
